```

### Known Risks

- Repo is young (Feb 3) with few stars — borderline on "avoid resources only a day or two old"
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` will get scrutiny — deny list in `src/permissions.ts` mitigates
- Maintainer runs `evaluate-repository.md` Claude evaluation — security section is thorough

### Expected Timeline

- **Bot validation:** Instant
- **Maintainer review:** 1-7 days
- **PR merge:** Hours after approval
